# Setup Apify CLI GitHub Action

## What is Apify?

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a full-stack web scraping and automation platform where developers can build, deploy, and publish serverless microapps called Actors.

## What does Setup Apify CLI GitHub Action do?

This GitHub action sets up the Apify CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow. It installs the specified version of Apify CLI and logs you in with your Apify token, making it ready for use in subsequent workflow steps.

## Inputs

**version** (optional): Version of Apify CLI to install (e.g. "1.1.1", "latest"). Defaults to the latest stable version.

**token** (required): Your Apify token for authentication. The CLI will be automatically logged in with this token. See the [Apify integration docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token) for instructions on how to find it.
